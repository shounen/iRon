# iRon
A fun Steam bot that sends/repies to messages to friends.

## How to use
Go into program.cs and enter a username/password crendential. 
Then run the c# file which will log in to the Steam account, add any friend requests, and message random people in the account's friend list.

Messages are randomly generated from an array of strings, and sent at random intervals of time. See code for more details on how to update/change this.
